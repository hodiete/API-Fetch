## How it works
   When you go to `http://localhost:3000/`, there is an inital list of work orders set to earliest work order deadline that shows the description of the work order, the worker's email, name and company, and the deadline for the order. There is a toggle switch to sort between the earliest and lastest orders and a search tool that searches for orders based on the name of the worker.
